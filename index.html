<div class="section">Grading</div>
<ul>
    <li>Presence on this subject is mandatory, and minimum of 4 attendances will be required.
    <li>Students will have 5 lab assignments; each assignment will receive a grade.</li>
    <li>Each deliverable for the laboratory assignments must be uploaded using: <a
            href="https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~pbt/">https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~pbt/</a> address with the scs id/password
        credentials.
    </li>
    <li>Each deliverable file must be uploaded <b>before</b> the scheduled laboratory, i.e. in the day of the assignment
        delivery.
    </li>
    <li>The student must have available the deliverable documents during lab hours to be discussed with the tutor.</li>
    <li>During one laboratory maximum 2 laboratory assignments could be delivered. The second laboratory will be
        delivered if there is time available. Priority is given to those students who have delivered the laboratory on
        time.
    </li>
    <li>Penalties
        <ul>
            <li>The assignments delivered after the scheduled delivery are marked with 2 points/laboratory delay.</li>
            <li>Example: Assignment 3 with a delivery schedule in Lab 4 but delivered in Lab 6, gets the maximum mark of
                6.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Tutor Grade</b> = arithmetic average of the grades from the 5 laboratory assignments (awarded at the
        end of the laboratory 6).
    </li>
    <li><b>Scientific Coordinator Grade</b> = given in the session.</li>
    <li><b>Final Grade</b> = 0.5 * Grade given by Tutor + 0.5 * Grade given by Scientific Coordinator</li>
    <li>Pass the subject: Final grade > = 5. Grade given by Tutor or Grade given by Scientific Coordinator may be less
        than 5, but the Final Grade must be greater than 5.
    </li>
    <li>In the retake session, the student can also deliver assignments that were undelivered during the didactic
        activity only if she/he has at least 4 attendances. The grade given by tutor will be at most 6 if during the
        semester the student did not deliver any assignment. If the student delivered parts of the assignments during
        the semester, and in the retake session she/he delivered some other assignments, the grade on each assignment is
        computed as if it were delivered in Lab 6 (with appropriate penalties), but the final grade will be at most 6.
    </li>
    <li>Students who do not have a minimum of 4 attendances may deliver them only in the liquidation session, and the
        tutor's grade will be maximum 6.
    </li>
</ul>
